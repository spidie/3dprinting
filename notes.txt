First - What is 3D Printing?
	A lot of manufacturing of solid objects takes something away
		Sculpting Wood
		Routing
		Cutting
		Laser Cutting
	Or forming - eg. Vacuum forming
	Moulding
	3D Printing is Additive Manufacturing
        Layering of materials on top of each other to create a solid object
        Plastic Extrusion - like a hot glue gun or cake icing
        Show Example Print
Flow
    3D Design
        Scan an existing object
            3D Scanner
                Commercial
                Hack together with Kinect
            Splice together 2D Photographs
            Mobile Phone App
        Pre-made
            Thingverse
                Remix
        Do It Yourself - 3D Design
            Google Sketchup
            Solidworks
            OpenScad
            Blender
        At this stage - you could outsource to Shapeways
    Slice
        extrusion speed (rotations / minute)
        head speed
        temperature
        Fan on/off
        wall thickness
        fill patterns
        multiple objects
        creates "gcode"
    Print
            Computer
                User Interface
                Sends Gcode to microcontroller
            Microcontroller
                Drives motors
                Controller heater
                Measures temperature of extruder
            Motors
                "Steppers" - same as in paper printers
                Extremely accurate rotation
            Sensors
                Endstops
            Extruder
                Very fine nozzle .5 or .35mm
                Heater
                    Power resistor
                    Wound wire around a core
            Materials
                3mm
                PLA
                    Extrudes at 160-200C
                    Biodegradable/compostable, made from corn and sugar cane
                    Heated bed not necessary, PET tape works
                    Cools slower, fast prints may require fan
                    Safe, pleasant fumes (smells like pancakes)
                ABS
                    Extrudes at 200-250C
                    Works best with heated print bed
                    Cools faster
                    Puts off fumes (possibly toxic)
                    Less brittle than PLA.
